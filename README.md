# tmpl

A RequireJS/AMD loader plugin for Handlebars templates.

Known to work in RequireJS, but should work in other AMD loaders that support the same loader plugin API.

This isn't my code, I am merely providing a home for it to live. Special thanks to [Adam Alexander](https://github.com/adamalex) for creating this plugin.
